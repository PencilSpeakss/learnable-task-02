## Version control
Version control is a tool that helps people work together on the same project and helps keeps an organised history of what was done, who did it, and when, making it easier to understand how a project has evolved. 
## Difference between Git and Github
 Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code or files. It's a command-line tool that you can use locally on your computer. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides a central location for Git repositories. It's a cloud-based service that allows you to host, manage, and share your Git repositories with others.
